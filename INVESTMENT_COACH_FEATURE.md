## Architecture

### Backend (Python)

**File:** `investment_coach.py`

The backend provides the AI-powered recommendation engine using HuggingFace's LLM:

- **ETF Database**: Comprehensive list of recommended ETFs categorized by risk level
- **Allocation Calculator**: Calculates optimal portfolio allocation based on user profile
- **AI Recommendations**: Generates personalized insights using LLM
- **Rebalancing Tips**: Provides ongoing portfolio management guidance

Key Functions:
- `generate_investment_recommendations()` - Main entry point
- `calculate_allocation()` - Determines stock/bond split
- `get_recommended_etfs()` - Selects appropriate ETFs
- `_call_chat()` - Interfaces with LLM

### Frontend (React)

**Components:**

1. **InvestmentCoach.jsx** (`src/components/investment/InvestmentCoach.jsx`)
   - Main investment coach component
   - Tabbed interface with 4 sections:
     - Overview: Strategy summary and key metrics
     - Recommendations: Detailed ETF recommendations
     - Allocation: Monthly investment breakdown
     - Actions: Step-by-step action plan

2. **InvestmentCoachPage.jsx** (`src/pages/InvestmentCoachPage.jsx`)
   - Standalone page for the investment coach
   - Displays user profile stats
   - Wraps the InvestmentCoach component

**API Service:** `src/api/investmentCoachService.js`

Handles communication between frontend and backend:
- `generateInvestmentRecommendations()` - Fetch AI recommendations
- `getETFInfo()` - Get detailed ETF information
- `getMarketAnalysis()` - Fetch market trends
- `getRebalancingSuggestions()` - Get portfolio rebalancing advice
- Includes comprehensive mock data fallback for development

   - Low risk: -20%
   - Medium risk: 0%
   - High risk: +10%
3. **Bounds**: Stock allocation between 20% and 90%
4. **Stock Breakdown**:
   - 50% US large-cap
   - 20% US small/mid-cap
   - 20% International
   - 10% Emerging/growth
