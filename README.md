# Ascend Finance

## What is this project?

Ascend Finance is an integrated platform and toolkit designed to help users (mainly recent college graduates entering the workforce) stay informed and make better decisions about financial markets. It combines frontend and backend components (built with JavaScript/TypeScript and Python) to deliver market insights, investment coaching features, data extraction, and more.

## Key Features

- Market Insights: Analyze financial market data to surface trends and actionable insights.  
- Investment Coach: A guided assistant that helps users plan investments and navigate complex financial topics.  
- Data Extraction & Storage: Backend scripts to extract, process, and store financial data for use in the system.  
- Frontend Interface: A user-facing interface (HTML/JavaScript/Vite/Tailwind) for interacting with the system.  
- Modular Architecture: The project is structured into multiple directories/components to keep frontend, backend, config, and assets separated.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript/TypeScript**, with frontend tooling including Vite, Tailwind CSS, and PostCSS.  
- **Python** scripts for backend processing (data extraction, coaching logic, analytics).  
- Various config and schema files for maintaining consistent data structures and application settings.
